# Indoor Helium Hotspot

## Introducing the Nebra HNT Indoor Hotspot Miner
Earn HNT cryptocurrency by mining Helium and building coverage for The People’s Network using the Nebra HNT Indoor Hotspot Miner. Anyone can join The People's Network and provide hundreds of square miles of wireless network coverage, while mining HNT on the Helium Blockchain just as hotspot miners do.

* Efficient miner for a new cryptocurrency, Helium (HNT)
* Complete set-up in minutes using a smartphone
* LongFi™ technology maximises range and battery life
* Low Power – uses as much power as a broadband router (15W)
* Easily manage Hotspots and tokens from the mobile app

## LongFi™ Technology
Helium LongFi™ is a technology architecture that combines a leading wireless technology, LoRaWAN, and the Helium Blockchain. LongFi™ is optimised for miles of range, and long battery life for IoT devices.


## Proof of Coverage
The Nebra HNT Indoor Hotspot Miner earns HNT Helium tokens when devices connect, and for validating wireless coverage delivered by peers. Using a system called Proof-of-Coverage, Hotspot Miners earn more HNT when they're in range of other miners, but need to be at least 300 metres apart.

The range depends on the environment:

* Rural areas: ~10 miles or more.
* Dense areas: ~ 1 mile.

Single HNT Hotspot Miners earn less as they can only issue Challenges over the internet, and can’t participate in Proof-of-Coverage.

## This kit comes with:
* Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+ 32GB EMMC Flash Storage.
* LoRa Concentrator Module.
* 2dBi Plastic Antenna.
* 12V Power Supply (Worldwide).
* 1M CAT5e Ethernet Cable
* Nebra ECC Key for securely storing your swarm key.
* **Please note: the current case picture is a placeholder image. We will update the images as soon as we have pictures of the new casing.**

## Specifications

* The HNT Hotspot Miner is powered by the Raspberry Pi Compute Module
* LoRa Module Support
* RF interface over 50 U.FL connector for RX and TX.
* Wi-Fi & Ethernet Connectivity
* Efficient Power Consumption
* Power via 12V 1.5A global power supply

## Why earn HNT & use Helium?

Millions of compatible devices can use The People's Network and each device requires Data Credits (DC) in order to send data to the Internet. Fixed in value, DC are created by 'burning' HNT, reducing the total supply to achieve a Burn and Mint Equilibrium. The more devices using DC, the more HNT will be burned.

Helium’s wireless network based on LoRaWAN is best suited for low-power scenarios like sending data to and from sensors using low-cost radio waves, eliminating reliance on more costly networks like cellular and WiFi. It’s fully peer to peer and leverages a robust network of hotspots connected to the network. With just 100 to 200 hotspots, the network can usually cover most cities. In return for hosting hotspots, hosts can earn $HNT for providing access to the LongFi network.

## How are Tokens Earned?
Hotspots earn HNT for building and securing network infrastructure and transferring device data. The amount of HNT distributed to Hotspots depends on the type of “work” they perform based on the value to the network. This validation of network contribution is accomplished by a new work algorithm called Proof-of-Coverage (PoC).

To participate in PoC there must be multiple Hotspots at least 300 meters apart in an area, but still within range of each other (up to many miles depending on environment). Single Hotspots earn less as they can only issue Challenges over the internet, and can’t participate in Proof-of-Coverage. After the first year, distribution amounts adjust.
