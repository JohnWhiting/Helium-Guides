## What is the difference between the Indoor & Outdoor Units?

The biggest difference is the outdoor unit comes in a case which is suitable to be used outside in mixed environments and has a few extra features.

To help you decide we've created this handy guide.

## When will the Nebra Hotspot ship?

We are targeting March 2021 for the Indoor Hotspot, and April 2021 for the Outdoor Hotspot.

## Does the Nebra Hotspot have Wi-Fi Connectivity?

Yes, both the Indoor & Outdoor Hotspots have Wi-Fi Connectivity with a 2.4Ghz 802.11n Wi-Fi Adaptor included in the units.

## What is the Ethernet speed of the units?

Both hotspots have 10/100 Mbps Ethernet connectivity, this is fast enough for the Helium Network and is typically 2x the speed of most Wi-Fi connections and 4x the speed of LTE connections.

## Can I add 4G connectivity to my Hotspot?

You can add an optional 4G module to the outdoor hotspot, this is a module that is simple to install when you receive your hotspot. We'll have a guide on how to do this at </outdoor-hotspot/lte-config>

The indoor unit does not have the ability to have a 4G Modem added, you could use a solution like a Mi-fi to achieve this.

## Does the 4G Module require a sim-card?

Yes you will need to sign up to a data plan with a mobile network.

We recommend this as it is typically cheaper to sign up to a local plan than the worldwide sims we could ship with it.

## How much internet data per month does the Hotspot use?

Currently we are roughly estimating 30-50GB per month so recommend a 50GB plan when using 4G.

The actual usage may be slightly less or more and will be something we up-date over time as we start measuring more units.

## Can I setup my Nebra Hotspot with the Helium App?

Yes, both units have Bluetooth which is used to communicate to the Helium App for initial setup.

Examples of how to set it up can be found in the quick-start guides.

## Are you an approved manufacturer of Helium Hotspots?

Yes, we have passed both HIP19 approval with Helium, and have also had our prototype unit's hardware validated. More details can be found on [Helium's Engineering Blog](https://engineering.helium.com/2021/01/26/maker-audit.html)

## What is the antenna connector on the Hotspot?

The indoor unit has a RP-SMA Female Connector on, and the outdoor unit has an N-Type female connector on.

## What antenna is included with the Hotspot?

We are currently confirming the final model of antenna included with the indoor hotspot.

For the outdoor hotspot we are including a 3dBm glass fiber antenna which can be also purchased separately at <https://www.nebra.com/products/rakwireless-glass-fiber-lora-gateway-antenna>.

## What is the power consumption of the Hotspot?

We rate the Indoor hotspot at 15W and the Outdoor hotspot at 18W. However these are the peak values rather than the constant power consumption.

Both units drop to approximately 10W during normal use.

This roughly equates to 0.25-0.3kWh per day or 100kWh per year.

## Can I mine <Alternative Cryptocurrency>?

No, the nebra Helium Hotspots only mine HNT.

## Where can I buy the Nebra Helium Hotspots?

We have a growing list of distributors on our [Distributors](distributors.md) page.
